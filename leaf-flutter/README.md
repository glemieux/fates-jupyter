# Issue 383 study

## Jupyter notebook descriptions

- [net_uptake-leaf_cost](https://github.com/glemieux/fates-jupyter/blob/netuptake/leaf-flutter/net_uptake-leaf_cost.ipynb): Original exploratory study notebook
- [issue383-optimum-clai-trim-fraction](https://github.com/glemieux/fates-jupyter/blob/netuptake/leaf-flutter/issue383-optimum-clai-trim-fraction.ipynb): Review of output from canopy trim fraction calculation using optimum clai
- [cesmlog-parser](https://github.com/glemieux/fates-jupyter/blob/netuptake/leaf-flutter/cesmlog-parser.ipynb): Script for parsing the cesm log of the `f10_f10_mg37` runs I conducted for determining the reason there was no comparitive differnce in `laimemory` between the normal runs and the optimized calculation

## Log output (Google Sheet)

To directly investigate the per-cohort, per-leaf-layer, per-patch calculations, I printed values to the land log output and then copy pasted them into a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JN41QdmcH-wu2q6ft9eto76AZuM1e2UufW0LbBHqc-0/edit#gid=99707911).

## ACRE comparison plots
